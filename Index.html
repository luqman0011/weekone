<p>Berlin is known as the capital city of Germany now that the country has been reunited. For most of the Cold War, the capital of West Germany was located in Bonn. It is known as the place where the Nazi regime came to an end and where Hitler killed himself in the Hitler Bunker, which still exists under a parking lot in the heart of the city.</p>
<p>Berlin is such a funny place. It’s one of those cities that is really just really cool and knows it. When I first moved to Berlin from a mid-sized German city, it was like going to the future – grocery stores open past 8PM, public transit that runs late, there’s even so much WiFi WLAN I don’t even know what to do with it, I need to cancel my data plan! I immediately saw what Germans mean when they say that Berlin is a city like no other in Germany.</p>
